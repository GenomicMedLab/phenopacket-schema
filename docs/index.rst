=====================================================
Welcome to the documentation for phenopackets-schema!
=====================================================

The goal of the phenopacket-schema is to define the phenotypic description of a patient/sample in the context
of rare disease, common/complex disease, or cancer. The schema as well as source code in Java, C++, and Python
is available from the `phenopacket-schema GitHub repository <https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema>`_.

The current document refers to the version 2 of the Phenopackets schema, which is currently being finalized by the
`Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) <https://www.ga4gh.org/>`_ Clinical & Phenotypic Data Capture workstream.
To see the documentation for version 1, which was approved by GA4GH in 2019,
