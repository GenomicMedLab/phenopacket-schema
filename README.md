# phenopacket-schema
Repository for the inlined phenopacket schema

This is a re-defined version of the original phenopacket with a more individual-centric approach. This new approach was taken in order to simplify the code required to represent and manipulate the data and also better represent this sort of data as it is in day to day use.

Currently this is very much work in progress and breaking changes will occur. Once we have settled on something stable we will draft a 1.0.0-RELEASE and thereafter stick to semantic versioning semantics.
