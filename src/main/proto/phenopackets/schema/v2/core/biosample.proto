// A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate
// molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g.
// sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples
// would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome
// sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation.
// Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g.
// genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.
